# The Extended Rippa's Algorithm (ERA) and its Stochastic version (SERA) for k-fold CV in RBF interpolation. Surrogate CV for RBF collocation

**Author**: F. Marchetti, University of Padova, Department of Mathematics "Tullio Levi-Civita";

The demo.m file refers to the ERA implementation provided in cv_rippa_ext.m

SERA is implemented in cv_rippa_ext_prob.m

The Surrogate CV algorithm for meshless collocation methods is implemented in surrogate_cv.m
